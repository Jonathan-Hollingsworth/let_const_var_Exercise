Original ES5:
var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

ES2015:
const PI = 3.14;
Pi = 42; //TypeError: Cannot redefine a Constant Variable


Quiz:
1. [var] can be redeclared and hoisted while [let] cannot ([var] is also function scoped while [let] is block scoped)
2. [const] is block scoped and cannot be redeclared redefined or hoisted while [var] is function scoped and capable of doing all three
3. [let] can be redefined but [const] can't
4. Hoisting is when the variable declared with [var] becomes declared (but not defined) at the top of their scope
